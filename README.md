NAME:  **KAREDDY INDIRA PRIYADARSHINI**
DESCRIPTION:

I am a dedicated person with an urge to learn and grow. My name is Indira and I feel life is a journey that leads to self-discovery.

I have learned punctuality and discipline are the two wheels that drive our life on a positive path. I am passionate about reading novels. When I was younger, my grandmother used to narrate stories about her life in the past and that has built my interest towards reading stories and novels related to history.

Overall I am an optimistic person who looks forward to life as a subject that teaches us values and ways to live for the upliftment of society.
